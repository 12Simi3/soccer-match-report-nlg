## Football Match Report Generator

This repository contains a small Python prototype that automatically generates a **short article (~300 words)** summarizing a football match from **scraped data**.

The goal is to create a **concise and readable match summary** that includes:

- When and where the match was played  
- Which teams competed  
- The final score  
- Key moments (goals, yellow/red cards)  
- Whether penalties were taken  

The prototype includes a **script that scrapes match data** (e.g., from *Livesport.cz*) and transforms it into a **natural-sounding text report**. 
It is designed to be modular and easy to extend.
